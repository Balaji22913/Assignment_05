These patterns may be influenced by factors like seasons, holidays, or other recurring events. Seasonality can be detected by observing repeated cycles or by using techniques such as seasonal decomposition.\n",

    "Cyclical: Cyclical patterns are similar to seasonality but occur over longer timeframes and do not have fixed intervals. They represent fluctuations in the data that are influenced by economic, political, or social factors. Cyclical patterns are often identified through visual inspection or advanced time series decomposition methods."
